Look for circular references:
 - CardActions, Entity::actionQueue -> has shared_ptr to owner
 - do CardActions outlive owners? use raw pointer?

SpriteProxyNode as shared_ptr throughout the engine?

Tiles as WeakWrapper // search -> Tile* / get_tile / Tile& / can_move_to_func

keep defense rule as shared_ptr in lua? // nah, but needs a plan

Battle::Tile::IsReservedByCharacter -> take in ids instead of shared_ptrs?
