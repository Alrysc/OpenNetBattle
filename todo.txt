Look for circular references:
 - CardActions, Entity::actionQueue -> has shared_ptr to owner

SpriteProxy as WeakWrapper // search "add_node", SceneNode*
Tiles as WeakWrapper // search -> Tile* / get_tile / Tile& / can_move_to_func
WeakWrapper for nearly everything instead of shared_ptr

// AsSpriteProxyNode???

keep defense rule as shared_ptr in lua? // nah, but needs a plan

Battle::Tile::IsReservedByCharacter -> take in ids instead of shared_ptrs?
