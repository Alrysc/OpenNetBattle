Look for circular references:
 - BattleSceneBase
 - Player
 - CardActions seem circular with actor/owner
 - shareHit in bnCharacter seems sus, prob circular, maybe use weak_ptr
 - More
 - Components seem fine as they're using weak pointers now
 - CardActions have a reference to their owner, does the owner have one back?
 - Check spells like SharedHitbox -> just recently switched to a weak_ptr

CardAction Step as shared_ptr
SpriteProxy as shared_ptr

// todo: break entity shared_ptr cycles
// also call this->FreeAllComponents();
// should the field and tiles be shared_ptr? as sprite proxy node???
// what about animations
// is Animation& safe? GetAnimationFromComponent?
// maybe return something that wraps the AnimationComponent like an animation component user type with the same exports


Battle::Tile& // check out stuff like scripted spells
