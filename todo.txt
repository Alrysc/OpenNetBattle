Scripting Changes:
 - Removed SpriteNode and Animation constructors
 - `SpriteNode:add_node(node)` is now `SpriteNode:add_node() -> node`
 - `SpriteNode:find_child_nodes_with_tags(tags)` removed
 - `SpriteNode:unwrap()` deprecated
 - `CardAction:add_attachment(parent, point_name, sprite)` is now `CardAction:add_attachment(point_name) -> attachment`
 - `CardAction:sprite()` added
 - `CardAction:use_animation()` removed
 - `CardAction:get_animation()` added
 - `Step:complete_step()` can only be called on the reference passed in update_func + draw_func
 - Comparisons on classes will always return false as they use different wrapper instances, use .get_id() for comparing entities

Other Changes:
 - Removed every Card from the game
   - Only the BusterCardAction remains
 - Removed every built in playable character
 - Crashes are far less likely
 - Battle Engine leaks should be gone
 - Many methods moved to Entity
 - Obstacles no longer inherit from Spell

Remaining issues:
 - ScriptedDefenseRule can leak if self captured in a closure (Using shared_ptr)
  - Requires api changes to fix, but documentation can be a decent temporary solution
 - Some classes such as Mobs and Tiles are still passed in as a pointer
  - I don't expect misusage of these to be common so I'm kicking fixing this for later
 - Comparisons always return false, we may want to add a custom comparison function using a raw pointer on the wrappers
 - CardAction::Step is a bit confusing
