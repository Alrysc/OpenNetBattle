## Update 4/12/2018
Wrote chip library, chip cust state, and chip component system for entities.
As of now, the chip cust inits the library and feeds chips into the selected chip queue. 
After the cust state is over and battle begins, the chip UI component attached to the player is loaded with the selected chip data.
Player can then uses these chips in order by pressing the action 2 button "Right control".
All memory is deleted and safely accounted for.

## Contributions to the project
Pheelbert wrote the base tile movement code, sprite resource loading, and the rendering pipeline. I've since then added many new features off the foundation. It's becoming something entirely new. 
Here are my changes and contributions in writing:

New: 

* Shader support in render pipeline
* Pixelated battle intro shader effect
* Pause & pause state shader effect
* Flash white when hit and shader
* Support for stun (yellow) shader
* Cust bar, cust bar progess logic, and cust bar shader
* MMBN identical Mettaur battle AI -> fight in order taking turns, metts do not attack open tiles ahead, metts toggle movement in restricted space
* Entity collision support -> Restrict movement if a tile is occupied
* HP dials in real-time when attacked
* Moving off cracked tiles become broken
* Broken tiles cooldown, flicker, and then restore
* Created audio resource manager with streaming and buffering. Has support for limited channels for an authentic retro experience.
* Provided all audio for the game
* Added many new sprites
* Additional keyboard events for more buttons
* Chip library system
* Chip data class
* Chip selection GUI and basic state system 
* Chip UI component for player -> Renders chip name and attack power
* Boss AI ProgsMan (work in progress)
* Throwable Spells

Changes:

* Fixed bullet bug -> Bullets would never make it to back row (index error)
* Fixed wave bug -> Metts in back row could not spawn spell ^
* Improved animation times for smoother natural mmbn experience
* Fixed mega death bug -> Game no longer freezes on close
* Keyboard names and controls
* Moved origin logic for health UI components into its own function in Entity class Entity::getAnimOffset()

A Megaman Battle Network project that I work on occasionally. Made from scratch with SFML and Thor in C++.

'extern/dlls/*(-d).dll' must be copied to the Release/ or Debug/

Be wary of the license, this project was created and I am still working on it for academic reasons. It would be a shame if someone were to steal my project and call it their own!
