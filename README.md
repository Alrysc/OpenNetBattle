A Megaman Battle Network project that I work on occasionally. Made from scratch with SFML and Thor in C++.

'extern/dlls/*(-d).dll' must be copied to the Release/ or Debug/

Be wary of the license, this project was created and I am still working on it for academic reasons. It would be a shame if someone were to steal my project and call it their own!
